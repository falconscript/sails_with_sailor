# Sails With Sailor (User)

## Description
This is an empty new Sails app with a basic User Model/Controller. This is to more closely match Django's built-in User model. User registration templates are also included to get started with a new project fast.

## Usage
Check out this repository, run the npm install, get the config/local.js file from the sailsjs repository and add it to this project.  
Also don't forget to set up a database connection and add it to config/connections.js   
Launch with ```sudo ./sails lift``` and view at http://localhost/ (port 80)

## Important files
The important files made for this project are api/User.js and api/UserController.js with some registration templates in /views.
